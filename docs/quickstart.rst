Quickstart
=============
This mini tutorial will serve as an entry point into TwitchIO 3.
After it you should have a small working bot and a basic understanding of TwitchIO.

If you haven't already installed TwitchIO 3, check out :doc:`installing`.


Tokens and Scopes
-------------------
For the purpose of this tutorial we will only be using an OAuth Token with permissions to read and write to chat.
If you require custom scopes, please make sure you select them.

Visit `Token Generator <https://twitchtokengenerator.com/>`_ and select the Bot Chat Token.
After selecting this you can copy your Access Token somewhere safe.
